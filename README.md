# LobotomyMod
Bringing the lobotomy meme to Lethal Company

![showcase](https://github.com/rudynakodach/LobotomyMod/blob/7437fe80f0671be7165415fa000bbb2fa9fa4a8b/README/showcase.gif)

## How it works
Each second there is a 5% chance to trigger a lobotomy attack **only if the player is critically injured**.

The mod takes a screenshot of the game's window and then displays it on top of UI to mimic the [lobotomy shitpost](https://youtu.be/m5Vj6BATWUo) and disorient the player.
